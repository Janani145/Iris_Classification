# Iris_Classification

The Iris project is a popular machine learning task based on the Iris dataset, which contains data on 150 samples of iris flowers belonging to three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—used to classify the species. The project involves exploring the dataset to understand the relationships between features, preprocessing the data to ensure it's clean and ready for analysis, and applying classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or k-Nearest Neighbors. After training and testing the model, its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices. This project is an excellent introduction to supervised learning and classification tasks, offering insights into data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
